    <h1>Chicken Curry</h1>

        <p>With the pop of spicy mustard seeds and heady fragrance of garam marsala, you can add as much chilli powder
            as you desire.
            Some Indian curries are made with a tangy tomato base and others on cream, yoghurt or coconut milk.
            This curry gives us the best of both worlds. Pieces of chicken are simmered in a spiced tomato sauce until
            tender and then finished off with rich and smooth coconut milk.</p>
